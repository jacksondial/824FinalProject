The purpose of this document is to create an ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model.

```{r}
# create time series object
date <- as.Date("1990-04-30")

# Extract the week of the year
week <- format(date, "%U")
week

all_data <- labels_train

ts_obj <- ts(labels_train$total_cases, frequency = 52, start = c(1990, 18)) # the start date was the 17th time period of that year, where time period is defined by the frequency argument

arima <- auto.arima()
```
