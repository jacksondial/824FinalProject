Read in data
```{r}
features_test <- read.csv("dengue_features_test.csv")
features_train <- read.csv("dengue_features_train.csv")
labels_train <- read.csv("dengue_labels_train.csv")
```

Test some automated EDA
```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, DataExplorer, tableone)
all_train <- left_join(features_train, labels_train, by = c("city", "year", "weekofyear"))

all_train %>% create_report(output_file = "EDA",
                            report_title = "EDA Report - Dengue Data",
                            y = "total_cases")

CreateTableOne(vars = colnames(select(all_train, -c("city", "year", "weekofyear",
                                                    "week_start_date"))),
               strata = c("city"),
               data = all_train)
```
